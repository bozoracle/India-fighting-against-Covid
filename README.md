# India-fighting-against-Covid # 

This project depicts the fight of India against Covid-19. 
The datasets are taken from various sources made available by Government of India as as worldwide data.

Various factors that are considered while working on this project are-
1. Where does India stand at present?
2. Is healthcare in India good enough to handle this situation on large scale?
3. Does population density has anything to do with spread of disease?

Before proceeding you need to install pycountry_convert, googlemaps and plotly if haven't used it before.
Going stepwise first perform countrywise analysis and then statewise to get bigger picture. Also analyse the healthcare facility in each state and over all India.
