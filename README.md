# India-fighting-against-Covid # 

COVID 19 has spread across the world so fast that it was impossible to take measures against it. 
Gradually it started spreading across the globe. In India the outbreak reached a bit late (in March 2020) as compared to the other countries, 
but it started to pick up pace within a short duration.

This project depicts the fight of India against Covid-19. 
The datasets are taken from various sources made available by Government of India as as worldwide data.

To come across this scenario, we need to answer few questions. Here are those questions:
1. Where does India stand at present?
2. Is healthcare in India good enough to handle this situation on large scale?
3. Does population density has anything to do with spread of disease?

The number of new cases are increasing day by day around the world. This dataset has information from the states and union territories of India at daily level.

State level data comes from Ministry of Health & Family Welfare.

Individual level data comes from covid-19 ndia.
## Dataset
* COVID-19 cases at daily level is present in covid_19_india.csv file.
* Individual level details are present in IndividualDetails.csv file.
* Population at state level is present in population_india_census2011.csv file.
* Number of COVID-19 tests at daily level in ICMRTestingDetails.csv file.
* Number of hospital beds in each state in present in HospitalBedsIndia.csv file.

Going stepwise first perform countrywise analysis and then statewise to get bigger picture. Also analyse the healthcare facility in each state and over all India. 

Using all this data I have attempted to analyse the data as much as I could. Analysis shows the India's ranking in the world and Asia. Also I have studied the doubling rate, testing labs facility in India, measures taken by India and various factors affecting the spread of Covid-19.
