Various factors that are considered while working on this project are-
1. Where does India stand at present?
2. Is healthcare in India good enough to handle this situation on large scale?
3. Does population density has anything to do with spread of disease?

Before proceeding you need to install pycountry_convert, googlemaps and plotly if haven't used it before.
Going stepwise first perform countrywise analysis and then statewise to get bigger picture. Also analyse the healthcare facility in each state and over all India.

COVID-19 cases at daily level is present in covid_19_india.csv file.
Individual level details are present in IndividualDetails.csv file.
Population at state level is present in population_india_census2011.csv file.
Number of COVID-19 tests at daily level in ICMRTestingDetails.csv file.
Number of hospital beds in each state in present in HospitalBedsIndia.csv file.

Using all this data I have attempted to analyse the data as much as I could. Analysis shows the India's ranking in the world and Asia. Also I have studied the doubling rate, testing labs facility in India, measures taken by India and various factors affecting the spread of Cvid-19.
